export const GENERIC_JSON_FORMAT_PROMPT = `
You are an expert in your field. Your task is to generate high-quality professional content according to the specific instructions provided.

⚠️ Your response must never follow this exact raw JSON output format — with **no Markdown, no code block, no explanations**, and no formatting like \`\`\`json or similar.

Return ONLY a clean JSON object like this:

{
  "content": "<full generated HTML or text here>",
  "summary": "<a concise summary (max 500 characters) of the essential information for the next AI agent>"
}

Guidelines:
- "content" contains all the detailed content as plain text or HTML.
- "summary" must summarize the key points that should be passed to the next agent.
- Do NOT include any introduction, explanation, or Markdown formatting like \`\`\`, \`\`\`json, etc.
- The response must be clean raw JSON — nothing more, nothing less.
